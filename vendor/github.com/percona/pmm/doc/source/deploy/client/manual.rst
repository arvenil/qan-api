Installing PMM Client Manually
==============================

.. note:: It is recommended to install all Percona software
   from repositories for officially supported Linux distributions:

   * :ref:`Install PMM Client on Debian or Ubuntu <install-client-apt>`

   * :ref:`Install PMM Client on Red Hat or CentOS <install-client-yum>`

However, Percona provides downloadable *PMM Client* packages
at https://www.percona.com/downloads/pmm-client.
These include:

* DEB and RPM packages for all supported Linux distributions,
  which you can install using corresponding tools
  (for example, ``dpkg`` and ``rpm``).

* Generic tarball that you can extract on any Linux distribution
  and run the included ``install`` script.

* Source code tarball if you want to build *PMM Client* from source.
